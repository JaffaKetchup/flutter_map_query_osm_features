Plugin for flutter_map that uses the Overpass API and OSM API to query features within a point's radius

Designed to work similarly to the Query Features function on [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org)'s front site.

Eventually, it is planned to link with ['flutter_map_tile_caching'](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter_map_tile_caching). It should be possible to select an area, such as a large building or relation, or even something like a nature park, then use the Custom Polygon Region (arriving in v9) to download it accurately.
